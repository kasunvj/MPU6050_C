# MPU6050_C

This is an example of a propotional controller designed for a single axis stabilizer. Two MPU6050 Guyros used to read data simultaniously. Control registers of MPU6050 has widely accessed and changed to get the expected behaviour. That led me to the ability of reading sensor values of 2 I2C communicating MPU6050 modules simultaniously and effectively.
